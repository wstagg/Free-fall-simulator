# Free Fall Simulator

# Welcome!

This is an application that allows the user to simulate either a ball or a cube falling from a chosen height at a chosen mass using real the free fall equations.

I have made this with the SFML library.

While the object is falling you get realtime data on the object height and current fall time. 

This application is still in development and I have a few more ideas I would like to add.

Thanks for looking.

To build this application you need to copy the fonts and texture folders to the build directory.
